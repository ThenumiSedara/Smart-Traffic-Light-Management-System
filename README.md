# Smart-Traffic-Light-Management-System

This paper presents a new approach to the Smart Traffic Light System, based on the potential that image processing holds for intelligent traffic control. The developed system is expected to increase the traffic flow because the traffic lights are adjusted dynamically based on the existing traffic, therefore raising the safety of the system. The system used advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques for purposes of detecting vehicles for effective detection of vehicles in realizing efficient and timely management of traffic. These will solve some of the most common problems in the transport sector, such as congestion and delays, in the process of the project by this critical node of technology meeting urban infrastructure. This will also prioritize emergency vehicles for improved time in their response and public safety in general. This is implemented by a rich suite of software and hardware tools; the system is majorly guided by Python and the YOLOv5 model for the detections in vehicles and traffic analysis. The system has been tested, and the result of the evaluation is positive, finding that it could contribute significantly to the improvement of traffic flow, reduction of congestion, and enhancement of safety. The Smart Traffic Light System is not just a development of technology in traffic management but a new contribution to the body of knowledge in the sense of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, which gives an effective and scalable solution to problems prevailing in the cities.
