# Smart-Traffic-Light-Management-System

About
Due to a huge number of vehicles ,very busy road and parking which may not be possible manually as a human being, tends to get fatigued due to monotonous nature of the job and they cannot keep track of the vehicles when there are multiple vehicles are passing in a very short time. So modern cities need to establish effective automatic systems for traffic management and scheduling. The objective of this project is to design and develop an accurate and automatic number plate recognition system, Automatic traffic light control using google Api live traffic density data, smart fine system and also We can track the lost vehicle using vehicle number plate detection and find its location by google Map API. Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System (ITMS) is an image processing and machine learning technology to identify vehicles by their license plates and we uses the microService of google API for live traffic density.
